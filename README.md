Repository for the II MIG Marine Coders Cell

Intro

Hello and welcome! As noted above, this is the main repository for the II MIG cell of Marine Coders - the larger, non official organization comprised of Active Duty / Reserve Marines, Marine Veterans, and U.S. Citizens.

Purpose

First and foremost - Marine Coders is glad to have you on the team. This organization was created with the intention of giving like-minded individuals with an interest in technology and problem solving an environment where they can collaborate and work through issues. As the organization grows, this repository will continually be updated with new members, current projects, potential projects, etc. Marine Coders is looking forward to watching and helping individuals step outside of their comfort zone in order to harness and develop their skills and interests!
